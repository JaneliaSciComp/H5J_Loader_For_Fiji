# h5j_loader-plugin
H5J Reader Plugin for Fiji project.

This project was borrowed from a "starter" project downloaded from the Fiji documentation page http://fiji.sc/Developing_Fiji_in_Eclipse.
The borrowed project was referred to as "minimal_project".  The purpose of this project, is to allow the HDF5 Janelia H.265
file format to be directly read, using File/Open, in the Fiji image processing app.
